2. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and widget tests in the test directory.
   - Run tests using: <br/> ```flutter test```

## **Setting Up Firebase for a Flutter Application (Android Only)**

**Step 1: Create a Firebase Project**
1. **Go to Firebase Console**:
   - Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click on **"Add Project"** and follow the steps to create a new Firebase project.
2. **Add Firebase to Your Android App**:
   - In the Firebase Console, click on the **Android icon** to add an Android app to your project.
   - Enter your app's package name (e.g., `com.example.my_flutter_app`).
   - Download the `google-services.json` file.
## **Step 2: Add Firebase to Your Flutter Project**
1. **Place `google-services.json` in Your Project**:
   - Copy the downloaded `google-services.json` file.
   - Paste it into the `android/app` directory of your Flutter project.
2. **Update `android/build.gradle`**:
   - Open the `android/build.gradle` file.
   - Add the following lines inside the `buildscript` block:
     ```gradle
     buildscript {
         dependencies {
             // Add the Google services classpath
             classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'
         }
     }
     ```
3. **Update `android/app/build.gradle`**:
   - Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
   - Add the following line at the bottom of the file:
     ```gradle
     apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
     ```
## **Step 3: Add Firebase Dependencies to Flutter**
1. **Add Firebase Packages**:
   - Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in your Flutter project.
   - Add the following dependencies:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       flutter:
         sdk: flutter
       firebase_core: latest_version
     ```
   - Replace `latest_version` with the latest version of the `firebase_core` package (check [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) for the latest version).
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run the following command in the terminal to install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     flutter pub get
     ```
## **Step 4: Initialize Firebase in Your Flutter App**
1. **Import Firebase Packages**:
   - Open the `lib/main.dart` file.
   - Add the following import at the top:
     ```dart
     import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
     ```
2. **Initialize Firebase**:
   - Modify the `main` function to initialize Firebase:
     ```dart
     void main() async {
       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
       await Firebase.initializeApp();
       runApp(MyApp());
     }
     ```
## **Step 5: Run Your Flutter App**
1. **Connect a Device or Emulator**:
   - Connect a physical Android device or start an Android emulator.
2. **Run the App**:
   - In the terminal, run the following command:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
## **Step 6: Verify Firebase Integration**
1. **Check Firebase Initialization**:
   - Add a print statement in the `main` function to verify Firebase initialization:
     ```dart
     void main() async {
       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
       await Firebase.initializeApp();
       print('Firebase initialized successfully');
       runApp(MyApp());
     }
     ```
2. **Run the App**:
   - Check the console output to ensure Firebase is initialized successfully.
## **Step 7: Add Additional Firebase Services (Optional)**
1. **Add Firebase Authentication**:
   - Add the `firebase_auth` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       firebase_auth: latest_version
     ```
   - Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
2. **Add Firebase Firestore**:
   - Add the `cloud_firestore` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       cloud_firestore: latest_version
     ```
   - Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
## **Step 8: Deploy Your App**
1. **Build the APK**:
   - Run the following command to build the APK:
     ```bash
     flutter build apk
     ```
2. **Deploy to Google Play Store**:
   - Follow the official Flutter documentation to deploy your app to the Google Play Store.
